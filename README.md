## Installation

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [GitBash](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [MySql Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) must be installed onto the userâ€™s computer. The recommended version of Node.js 18.17.1 LTS.

[Instructions for installing MySql Server](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mysql/mysql-installation-guide)

Once the required software has been successfully installed on the computer, clone this GitHub repository to a desired folder on the computer.

[The Repository of the MySql Company Database](https://github.com/Hello-AndyJoe/Challenge-12-SQL-CompanyDB)

The cloned repository does not include the node_module foldr containing the Inquirer, Express or MySQL2 NPMs. Install them into the repository by running `npm i` in a GitBash terminal within Visual Studio Code. 


## Usage

After completing the necessary installations outlined above, the SQL database still needs to be created on the same computer with the cloned repository. 

Open a terminal in the Database folder that is within the cloned respoitior.

Input `mysql -u root -p`, hit enter and then input the password that is associated and was created during installation of the MySQL server. 

Next, enter `source schema.sql` to creat the database with its related tables and then enter `source seeds.sql` to seed the database's tables.

This terminal can now be exited, and then within the parent folder of the clone repository a new terminal should be opened. Before continuing, the password value in the `const db` variable at the top of the server.js file must be changed to match the password mentioned previously in this usage guide.

Enter `node server.js` to begin the starting prompt and select from the various options to either view a table, add to a table or update a table. These options will present addition prompts to follow to carry out the actions invovled.
